    "## EU Recycling\n",
    "European policymakers have long recognized that better waste recycling is crucial for environmental protection, resource conservation, and sustainable growth. EU waste policy is central to the Circular Economy vision – the idea of keeping materials in use for as long as possible and minimizing waste. In fact, EU directives on waste management have been enacted to push member states up the “waste hierarchy” (prioritizing prevention, then reuse, then recycling, over disposal [3]). These laws aim to extract value from what we throw away and reduce environmental harm. For example, the Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) created a broad legal framework for waste in Europe, setting ambitious recycling targets and mandating national waste plans. Under this directive, countries were required to recycle at least 50% of household (municipal) waste by 2020, with even higher goals of 60% by 2030 and 65% by 2035 [1]. Complementing this, the Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive (94/62/EC, later updated) compels high recovery of packaging materials (aiming for about 65% recycling of all packaging by 2025 [1]), and the WEEE Directive (2012/19/EU) addresses electronic waste by setting collection and recycling requirements for e-waste. Through such policies – along with others like the Landfill Directive to curb dumping – the EU has built a comprehensive regulatory push to improve recycling rates and move Europe toward a circular economy. The motivation behind these directives is clear: waste that isn’t recycled represents lost raw materials and often ends up polluting land, water, and air. By enforcing common rules, the EU strives to ensure all member states contribute to the environmental goals and benefit from the economic opportunities of recycling (like job creation in the recycling industry and reduced raw material imports) [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recycling Disparities\n",
    "Despite these regulations and goals, monitoring compliance and progress is a critical ongoing need. Europe’s waste challenge remains significant – the average European generates around 500–600 kg of municipal waste per year, and as of 2020 roughly 49% of that (just about half) was recycled [1] [2]. This is a notable improvement from a decade ago (when only around 37% was recycled [1]), indicating that EU policies and national efforts have had an impact. However, this EU-wide average hides stark differences across countries. In some member states, less than a third of waste gets recycled, and over 60% of household waste still ends up in landfills [3] – a sign of lagging performance – whereas other states have become recycling frontrunners, already surpassing the EU’s 2025 targets with well over half of their waste recycled. These disparities raise important questions about why certain countries succeed and others struggle, and they underscore why the EU cares deeply about tracking and understanding recycling progress. The European Commission doesn’t just set targets – it actively checks how each country is doing, producing “early warning” assessments to flag member states at risk of missing upcoming recycling goals [1]. Such oversight is essential to ensure that environmental directives are implemented effectively and that the EU’s collective goals (like reducing landfill use to under 10% by 2035 [1]) will be met. This is where data-driven analysis becomes invaluable: by examining trends over time and patterns across countries, we help to reveal what’s working, what isn’t, and what factors might be driving these outcomes. With vast datasets collected (e.g. through Eurostat and national reports), we strive to make sense of the numbers – identifying successes to replicate, pinpointing gaps that need intervention, and ultimately supporting better policy decisions. \n",

It is calculated by summing the recycled municipal waste of all 27 member states and dividing this by the sum of the total municipal waste generated in these countries, then multiplying by 100 to obtain a percentage.

    "- `_tonnes`: value expressed as **absolute mass** (thousand tonnes), suitable for analysing total volumes over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `waste_generated_kg_capita` / `waste_generated_tonnes`\n",
    "\n",
    "These columns represent the **total amount of municipal waste generated** in a given country and year. Generation refers to waste handed over to the municipal collection system (or equivalent), mainly from households but also from commerce, offices and public institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `waste_treated_total_kg_capita` / `waste_treated_total_tonnes`\n",
    "\n",
    "These indicators show the **total amount of municipal waste that underwent any treatment operation** (recovery or disposal) in that country and year. Treatment includes all operations after collection, such as recycling, composting, incineration and landfilling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `waste_landfill_kg_capita` / `waste_landfill_tonnes`\n",
    "\n",
    "These columns capture municipal waste sent to **landfill or other final disposal operations** (codes D1–D7, D12 in EU waste legislation). Landfilling means depositing waste in or on land (e.g. landfill sites or surface impoundments) with no intention of recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. `waste_incinerated_kg_capita` / `waste_incinerated_tonnes`\n",
    "\n",
    "These indicators refer to municipal waste treated by **incineration as a disposal operation** (code D10), where the primary purpose is to destroy waste rather than to recover energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. `waste_incinerated_energy_kg_capita` / `waste_incinerated_energy_tonnes`\n",
    "\n",
    "These indicators represent **incineration with energy recovery** (code R1), where waste is burned to generate useful energy (electricity, heat, or both) and the plant meets EU efficiency criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. `waste_energy_recovery_kg_capita` / `waste_energy_recovery_tonnes`\n",
    "\n",
    "These columns summarise **energy recovery from municipal waste**, typically corresponding to operations where waste replaces other fuels and the main outcome is usable energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. `waste_recycled_total_kg_capita` / `waste_recycled_total_tonnes`\n",
    "\n",
    "These indicators show the **total amount of municipal waste recycled**, combining both material recycling and biological recycling (composting and anaerobic digestion). Recycling means reprocessing waste materials into products, materials or substances for the same or a different purpose, excluding energy recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. `waste_recycled_material_kg_capita` / `waste_recycled_material_tonnes`\n",
    "\n",
    "These columns quantify **material recycling**, where non-organic waste (e.g. paper, glass, metals, plastics) is reprocessed into new materials or products.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9. `waste_composted_kg_capita` / `waste_composted_tonnes`\n",
    "\n",
    "These indicators represent **biological recycling** of biodegradable municipal waste through **composting and anaerobic digestion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 10. `waste_reuse_kg_capita` / `waste_reuse_tonnes`\n",

    "We have successfully transformed the raw Eurostat datasets into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis.  \n",
    "The processing pipeline consisted of three main stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Import & Initial Cleaning**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Datasets:** Loaded five distinct datasets:  \n",
    "- Packaging Waste  \n",
    "- Municipal Waste  \n",
    "- E-Waste  \n",
    "- Waste Management Operations\n",
    "- Education\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cleaning Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Removed fully empty columns (e.g., `CONF_STATUS` containing only NaNs).  \n",
    "- Removed constant columns with no information gain (e.g., `freq`, which always contained `'A'` for Annual).  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Structure Optimization (Redundancy Removal)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code vs. Label:**  \n",
    "The raw data contained redundant pairs of columns (e.g., `\"AT\"` vs. `\"Austria\"`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Legend Creation:**  \n",
    "We extracted the mappings between codes and descriptions and documented them in the **Data Dictionary (Section 3)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Measures:**  \n",
    "- Dropped verbose description columns (`Geopolitical entity`, `Unit of measure`, etc.).  \n",
    "- Removed technical metadata such as `STRUCTURE_ID`.  \n",
    "- Retained only compact, efficient code-based columns for further analysis.  \n",

    "\n",
    "### **3. Advanced Transformation (Pivot)**\n",

    "Those dataset was originally in **Long Format**, containing multiple waste operations and educational levels in stacked rows (e.g. for `waste_per_capita`, GEN, DSP, RCY).\n",

    "**Transformation:**  \n",
    "Applied a pivot operation to restructure the dataset:\n",

    "- **From:** Multiple rows per country-year, one per waste operation / educational level \n",
    "- **To:** A single row per country-year with separate columns for each operation / level \n",
    "  (e.g., `waste_generated`, `waste_incinerated`, `waste_recycled`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Units:**  \n",
    "Because Eurostat reports both relative and absolute measures, we preserved unit information inside column names. E.g.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `*_kg_capita` → For cross-country comparability (population-adjusted).  \n",

    "# Data Aggregation (Master Dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "The five cleaned Eurostat datasets are consolidated into a single **master panel dataset** using a scaffold-based approach. This guarantees a balanced country–year structure and makes all indicators directly comparable across time and space.\n",
    "\n",
    "A direct merge on the original datasets was not sufficient, because **none of the four sources provides complete coverage for all 28 entities and all years 2000–2023 simultaneously**. Each dataset has its own gaps in time and country coverage, so a simple intersection would either drop many years or exclude some countries. To avoid losing information and to keep the panel structurally consistent, a synthetic country–year scaffold is used as the backbone.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Aggregation Strategy (Scaffold Method)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Time window**  \n",
    "   The analysis is restricted to the years **2000–2023**, in line with the defined project scope for the waste and recycling indicators.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scaffold construction (balanced panel)**  \n",
    "   A complete **country–year grid** is created from:\n",
    "   - 28 entities (the 27 EU member states plus the aggregate `EU27_2020`, or the selected country set for the analysis).\n",
    "   - 24 years (2000–2023).  \n",
    "   This results in a target of **28 × 24 = 672** rows. The scaffold DataFrame contains all combinations of `geo` (country code) and `TIME_PERIOD` (year), even if some indicators are missing for a given pair. Missing values in the final panel therefore represent genuine data gaps in the Eurostat series rather than structural holes in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Merging procedure**  \n",
    "   The cleaned datasets are then merged onto this scaffold via sequential **left joins** on `geo` and `TIME_PERIOD`:\n",
    "   - Municipal recycling rates (`sdg_11_60`),\n",
    "   - Packaging recycling rates (`ten00063`),\n",
    "   - E‑waste recycling rates (`cei_wm060`),\n",
    "   - Education (`edat_lfs_9903`),\n",
    "   - Municipal waste generation and treatment in wide format (`waste_ops_wide` / `env_wasmun`).  \n",
    "   This ensures:\n",
    "   - Every country–year combination in the scaffold appears exactly once.\n",
    "   - All available indicators are attached where data exist, while the scaffold itself remains complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Panel structure**  \n",
    "   The final master dataset is indexed by a **multi-index** (`geo`, `TIME_PERIOD`), so that each row corresponds to one country–year combination and all waste‑ and recycling‑related variables are available as aligned columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-Merge Preparation: Renaming Strategy\n",

    "- **Trend**: Consistent improvement from **27.3% (2000) → 47.2% (2019) → 49.7% (2023)**\n",
    "- **Key Achievement**: Despite the stricter measurement methodology introduced in 2020, recycling rates remained stable, demonstrating that EU recycling infrastructure is genuinely robust\n",
    "- **Current Status**: The EU has nearly doubled its municipal waste recycling rate over 23 years, approaching the 50% milestone\n",
    "- **Challenge**: Growth has plateaued around 49-50%, indicating that further improvements require technological innovation for difficult-to-recycle materials and contaminated waste streams\n",

    "#### Packaging Waste (Orange Dashed Line)\n",
    "- **Trend**: Consistently high performance at **64-67% (2012-2023)**\n",
    "- **Why Higher?**: Packaging materials (paper, glass, metal, aluminum) are:\n",

    "- **What This Means**: The EU is processing **twice as much recycled material** compared to 2000\n",
    "- **Drivers**:\n",
    "  - Improved collection systems (separate bins, deposit schemes)\n",
    "  - Expansion of materials accepted (now includes many plastics and organics)\n",
    "  - Population growth and increased waste generation\n",

    "**Landfill (Grey Bar) – COLLAPSE**\n",
    "- **Decline**: ~112 million tonnes (2000) → ~55 million tonnes (2023) = **51% reduction**\n",
    "- **Significance**: This is the most important environmental achievement—diverting waste from permanent burial\n",
    "- **Driver**: EU Landfill Directive (1999) set strict reduction targets, forcing member states to invest in alternatives\n",
    "- **Remaining Challenge**: 25% of waste is still landfilled; the EU target for 2035 is ≤10%\n",
    "\n",
    "**Energy Recovery (Orange Bar) – RISE**\n",
    "- **Growth**: ~20 million tonnes (2000) → ~57 million tonnes (2023)\n",
    "- **Classification**: Considered a **recovery operation** (not disposal) under EU law because energy is extracted\n",
    "- **Technology**: Modern waste-to-energy plants with district heating systems (common in Nordic countries)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incineration without Energy Recovery (Red Bar) – NEAR ELIMINATION**\n",
    "- **Decline**: ~16 million tonnes (2000) → ~1 million tonnes (2023)\n",
    "- **Reason**: EU Best Available Techniques (BAT) standards now require energy recovery systems on incineration facilities\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Treated Waste (Black Dashed Line) – SLIGHT GROWTH**\n",
    "- **Trend**: ~209 million tonnes (2000) → ~227 million tonnes (2023) = +9%\n",
    "- **Interpretation**: Total waste volume has NOT significantly decreased despite circular economy efforts\n",
    "- **Success Metric**: The composition has shifted dramatically toward recovery rather than disposal\n",
